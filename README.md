# Packlist

Packlist is an app to help you pack for your next trip. It's a work in progress, and I'm slowly chipping away at this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Jkz2N039/packlist).

## Usage

Build and start the app locally by running these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/nrbernard/packlist.git
cd packlist
npm install
npm build:css
npm meteor
```

To have the app watch for changes and compile stylesheets automatically, run `npm start`.
